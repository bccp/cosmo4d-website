            The <b>Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics</b> (BCCP) is focused on understanding the origin and evolution of the universe through a series of programs to define the observations, experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental questions in cosmology.

            Combining experimentation, computation, and theory, BCCP continues to develop the foundation of an accurate, reliable model of the cosmos. We compare the implications of this evolving model against observations â€” thus opening new horizons and expanding our knowledge of the universe.
