            <h2> 2D Reconstruction: weak lensing </h2>
	    <p>As light from a distant star or galaxy is passing near a large amount of mass, such as a dark matter halo, its otherwise straight path gets changed by the gravitational field of the large mass. Therefore, the image that we observe becomes is a distorted version of the original. This effect is called <b>gravitational lensing</b>. The Hubble Space Telescope image below shows the distortion of the images of distant galaxies around a massive cluster of galaxies.</p>
	    <img src = "http://hetdex.org/images/dark_energy/strong_lensing_slide36high.jpg" alt>
	    <p>There are two types of lensing - strong and weak. Strong lensing refers to the case when the images are clearly distorted, and sometimes even multiple images of the distant galaxies are produced. The image above demonstrates strong lensing. Weak lensing, on the other hand, occurs when the light from the distant source passes further away from the large masses, or closer to not so large masses. The result is slight distortion in the image.</p>
	    <p>This effect allows us to indirectly see dark matter (dark matter is dark by definition, so we cannot observe it directly). By using the shear data (which describes distortions of the original image) from a large number of sources one can reconstruct the dark matter density field. We show this with our simulations below.
	    <div class="content">
		    <h2>Initial simulation</h2>
		    <p>The initial density field is simulated from a given power spectrum. What we observe through weak lensing is not the density field directly, but rather two shear fields. Shear 1 describes distortions in the horizontal and vertical directions, and shear two describes distortions in the diagonal directions.</p>

		    <h2>Mask and noise</h2>
		    <p>
		    Parts of the sky are unobservable because of bright stars. Also, our observations are noisy. Here we show the mask and the noise. The noise level in this simulations varies across the sky as shown in the image below.

		    <h2>Power spectrum deficit</h2>
		    <p>As we can see above the reconstructed density field matches the initial simulation very well. However, we can see that the structure on very small scales is missing in the reconstruction. That is because of noise. We can see the loss of power on small scales in the following plot of the <b>power spectrum</b>, i.e. the two-point function.</p>
		    <p align="center">\(<\delta(\mathbf{k})\delta(\mathbf{k^\prime})>=P(k)\delta_{\mathbf{kk^\prime}}\)</p>

		    <p>The green curve shows the original model from which the initial density field is simulated. The power of the simulated field is shown in red, and the power of the reconstructed field is shown in blue. As we can see, there is deficit of power for large \(k\), i.e. small scales. There is also loss of power for the largest scale (smallest \(k\)). This is because the weak lensing data is insensitive to the mean density field, so the reconstructed field will have zero mean.</p>
		    </br>
		    <h2>Power spectrum reconstruction</h2>
		    <p>We reconstruct the missing power in two steps. First, we perform a few simulations of just noise and run the same optimization algorithm. This allows us to estimate the <b>noise bias</b>, i.e. how much of the reconstructed power comes from noise. Next, we perform simulations of the data, but we inject a small amount of extra power in one of the bins. We then run the same optimization method again. The reconstructed density field will have some extra power in some of the bins. This allows us to estimate the response of all the bins to a small change of initial power in a given bin. By repeating this step for all the bins we are able to reconstruct the full <b>Fisher matrix</b>. Using the Fisher matrix and the noise bias we can then get an estimate of the original power spectrum, including error bars.</p>

		    <p>The plot above shows the reconstructed power spectrum with the error bars in cyan. The agreement with the original model power spectrum (in green) is very good.
