            <h2>An Introduction to Physical Cosmology</h2>
            <p>Cosmology (from the Greek κόσμος, kosmos "world" and -λογία, -logia "study of"), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.[1] Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology. </p>
                        <p>
                        Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics;[2] more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.</p>

                    <h2>Large Scale Structures in the Universe</h2>
                    <p>In physical cosmology, structure formation refers to the formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters and larger structures from small early density fluctuations. The universe, as is now known from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, began in a hot, dense, nearly uniform state approximately 13.8 billion years ago.[1] However, looking in the sky today, we see structures on all scales, from stars and planets to galaxies and, on still larger scales still, galaxy clusters and sheet-like structures of galaxies separated by enormous voids containing few galaxies. Structure formation attempts to model how these structures formed by gravitational instability of small early density ripples.[2][3][4][5]

                    <p> Fortunately, the physics of strucutre formation is relatively clean. Perturbative approaches is another possibility. Although gravity is non-linear, straight forward numerical simulations gives accurate predictions of structure formation. </p>
