            <h2>An Introduction to Physical Cosmology</h2>
            <p>Cosmology (from the Greek κόσμος, kosmos "world" and -λογία, -logia "study of"), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. 
               Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, 
               as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
            </p>
            <p>This picture by <a href="https://writescience.wordpress.com/tag/cosmic-microwave-background/">Shane Larson</a> demonstrates the idea behind this. On one
               side we have the theory of gravity and structure formation, on the other side, we have observational data. Physical cosmology bridges these two. </p>

            Next, we look at the predominate feature in the Universe, the Large scale Structure.

                    <h2>Large Scale Structures in the Universe</h2>
                    <p>In physical cosmology, structure formation refers to the formation of galaxies, galaxy clusters and larger structures from small early density fluctuations. 
                       The universe, as is now known from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, 
                        began in a hot, dense, nearly uniform state approximately 13.8 billion years ago.
                        However, looking in the sky today, we see structures on all scales, from stars and planets to galaxies and, on still larger scales still, galaxy clusters 
                        and sheet-like structures of galaxies separated by enormous voids containing few galaxies. 
                        Structure formation attempts to model how these structures formed by gravitational instability of small early density ripples.
                    </p>
                    <p> Below is a video (by Yu Feng) that demonstrates this process. 
                        Structures (filaments and halos) form as time evolves. 
                        At the center of halos where the density is highest, 
                       galaxies and super-massive black holes form and emit light that we can observe with telescopes. </p>

                    <h2>Theory of structure formation</h2>
                    <p>We do have a relatively accurate understanding of the physical theory behind the Universe.</p>
                    <p>The standard model of cosmology, \(\Lambda\)CDM model, was discovered around the 1990s, and the current observational data strongly
                       supports this model.
                    </p>
                    <ul> The model describes the Universe with 6 parameters:
                        <li>mass fraction of cold dark matter \(\Omega_C \sim 0.260\), </li>
                        <li>mass fraction of baryons \(\Omega_b \sim 0.049\), </li>
                        <li>hubble constant \(H_0 \sim 67.7 \mathrm{km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}\), </li>
                        <li>amplitude of primodial fluctuation \(A_s = 2.44\times 10^{-1}\), </li>
                        <li>reionization optical depth\(\tau = 0.07\), </li>
                        <li>primodial spectrum index \(n_s = 0.967\), </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Current and next generation observations are constraining these parameters to sub-percent level accuracy.
                        Extensions to the model includes a varying dark matter equation of state, non-gaussianity of the primodial fluctuation,
                        gravity beyond generalitivity, and tensor modes in the primodial fluctation.
                    </p>
                    <p>The gravitional effect of dark energy drives the expansion of the universe.
                       On this expanding background, the matter component (dark matter and baryon) collapses by gravity to form structures,
                       halos. Galaxies form in the center of halos, emitting light for us to observe. The effect of baryons are secondary,
                        consisting of hydrodynamics, radiation, atomic cooling, and feedback from stars and blackholes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Advanced large scale parallel computer algorithms, most notably N-body simulations provides
                        fast and accurate predictions of the primary
                        gravitional component of structure formation.

                    Our current theoretical understanding of structure formation can accurately predict the formation of halos and galaxies
                        for any given initial condition and cosmological parameters.
                        The level of systematis in the model is subdominant comparing
                        to the level of uncertainties from observations.

                    <h2>Power and limitation of data</h2>
                    <p>Observational data has been the most intrumental tool for us to understand our Universe. Observational data
                       sets are growing in size. Our current way of comprehending the observed data set is by model fitting / sampling
                       over the 2 point statistics of observed data. The existing approach has been extremely succesful. For example,
                       The following figure shows the best fit model of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum against
                       data measured from the Planck satellite. The uncertainty in data is very small, and the agreement between model
                       and data is very high.
                    </p>
                    <p><img class='image 8u' src="images/planck15-tt.png"/></p>
                    <p>
                       With this approach, however, it is hard to quantify the amount of information that has been fully recovered from
                       the data. The data that goes into the fitting is heavily compressed into 2 point statistics, a 1 dimentional function.
                       We do expect the loss of information due to this compression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In addition, because the speed of light is finite and the universe is vast, when we observe the universe,
                       we only see it at the time light is emitted from a distant past.  
                       The following figure shows how the age of the observed universe increases as the distance to us increases.
                    </p>
                   <img class='image 6u center' src="images/age-distance.png"/>
                    <p>
                        As an example, the Planck and WMAP satellites observed the cosmic
                        microwave background radiation in the universe at a distance of 14 Giga-parsec (45.5 billion light years) away,
                        and at a time of 13.7 billion years ago. The light appears to be travelling faster because light travels as
                        the universe expands, an effect due to General Relativity.
                        As another example, one of the main sample of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the CMASS sample, was a population of galaxies
                        2 Giga-parsec (6.76 billion light years) away, and at a time of 5.44 billion years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p> It is also slightly messy to directly include the difference of structure at different distance
                        in the model.</p>
                    <p>
                        With Cosmo4D, we take a cleaner approach. We will define the model \( S \) at the time of the initial density flucutation
                        in the Universe. A forward modelling dynamics \( F(S) \) relates the initial condition to the observed universe, where we define
                        the goodness of the model with a plain \(\chi^2 \sim (F(S) - F(D))^2 \). The full model includes 3 spatial dimensions and the evolution in time.

                        Hence
                        \[
                            3 + 1 = 4,
                        \]

                        Cosmo4D is phyiscal cosmology in the lingo of machine learning. 
                    </p>
                    <p> We are actively developing the method. In this demo, we will show two examples:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Reconstruction of Density from Cosmic Shear (2-D spatial + 1-D time + Linear dynamics) </li>
                        <li> Reconstruction of Dark Matter Initial Condition (3-D spatial + 1-D time + Non-Linear dynamics) </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> But first, let's take a look at the L-BFGS optimization algorithm that formed the backbone of Cosmo4D.</p>
