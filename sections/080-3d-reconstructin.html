                <p> The forward modeling dynamics that relates final and initial condition is Zel'dovich + Gaussian smoothing at 4 Mpc/h. 
                    This simple dynamics mimic the behavior of linear biasing and halo scale smoothing. A small white noise is introduced to the data. 
                    Even though the dynamics involves only one time step, it is already capturing the essence of the full non-linear problem of structure formation.
                </p>
                <p>We see as the L-BFGS iterations reduces chi square, the model agrees with the data at large scale (small k) in terms of power spectrum and high cross correlation. 
        The initial condition is also recovered, but notice the a bias at intermediate scales (around k = 0.1). The residual has very low power, though slightly correlated with the data, an indicator of possible over-fitting. This is a topic that we are currently investigating.</p>
