            <p>In this section, we demonstrate reconstruction of the cosmic initial condition with L-BFGS
                and Zel'dovich structure formation model.</p>

            <p> The video demonstrates the iterations where L-BFGS finds the initial condition. We will explain
                the details later. </p>

                <li>
                    Zel'Dovich approximation is the first order Lagrangian perturbative solution to the structure
                    formation model. It is the simplest non-linear structure formation model under gravity that
                    one can write down.
                </li>
                <li> We apply a Gaussian smoothing filter with a width of 4 Mpc/h.
                    This simple dynamics mimic the behavior of linear biasing and halo scale smoothing. </li>
                <li> The forward modeling theory for both the model and the data are the same,
                    except a small white noise of amplitude \( \sigma \) is introduced to the data.

                    Very quickly (with &lt; 100 iterations),
